na-sandbox sandboxes a program to constrain and measure time and memory usage.
na-sandbox uses cgroups and pivot_root to guarantee security. It is primarily
intented to evaluate user programs on nerdarena.ro

USAGE:
    na-sandbox [OPTIONS...] PROGRAM [-- PROGRAM_ARGS...]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Prints this help message.

    -t, --time <time>
            User time limit. If the program uses more user time than the
            amount given, it will be killed. Multiple threads running at the
            same time will add up their user time. Given as an unsigned
            number followed by one of the following suffixes: ns(nanoseconds),
            ms(milliseconds) or s(seconds).

    -w, --wall-time <wall-time>
            Wall time limit. If the program runs longer than this (in real
            time) it is killed. Given as an unsigned number followed by one of
            the following suffixes: ns(nanoseconds), ms(milliseconds) or
            s(seconds)

ARGS:
    PROGRAM
            The program to run, relative to the pivoted root.

    PROGRAM_ARGS
            Arguments to pass to the program.
